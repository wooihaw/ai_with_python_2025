    "Write a program to track the growing amount of investment over time. An initial deposit, called the principal amount, is made. Each year, the amount increased by a fixed percentage, called the annual rate of the return. For example, a principal amount of RM100 with an annual rate of return of 5% increases the ﬁrst year by RM5. The second year, the increase is 5% of the new amount RM105, which is RM5.25, and the new amount becomes RM110.25. The program prompts the user to enter an initial amount, an annual rate (percentage) of return, and a number of years. It then prints out the amount of investment, rounded to 2 decimal places at the end of each year for the specified number of years."
